Generic Workflow for Didactic Purposes

1. General Analysis of the Data: The tools should be able to display header content, shot images, and spectral analysis. Throughout the entire processing flow, after each step, this data will be checked for quality control.*
2. Frequency Filters: Bandpass and slope.*
3. Static Filter*
4. Debubble: Debubble by deconvolution.*
5. Deghost*
6. Debubble*
7. Velocity Analysis: Picking velocities for the first stack. The user needs to see the semblance, velocity model, and stacked CDP gather.*
8. Mute: Mute the direct wave.*
9. Water Depth
10. Spherical Divergence
11. Surface-Related Multiple Removal*
12. Velocity Analysis
13. FK Filter
14. Final Stack*
